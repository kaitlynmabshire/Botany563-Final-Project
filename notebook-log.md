#Description of Dataset
SP6-9 and Dlx are expressed in cephalopod cephalic tentacles (i.e., eye/olfactory stalks; limbs). However, much is unknown about SP6-9 and Dlx in other mollusk groups, except that SP6-9 is duplicated across mollusca. Examining the evolution of these two genes within mollusks will help address fundamental questions underlying the evolution of novel phenotypes, as well as the consequences of gene duplication and loss.


#Current and Future Steps
##Current
1) Potential ortholog sequences will be found using reciprocal BLAST across available mollusk genomes, with an annelid outgroup. 
2) Assemble *Cornu aspersum* transcriptome (received 02/13/2023) and find SP6-9 and Dlx

##Future
